### Problem Statement :-

*ðŸ›’ The Ghost Cart: Turning Abandonment into Opportunity*

*Imagine walking into a store, filling your basket, then walking out without buying anything. Thatâ€™s what happens online â€” billions of times a year. Cart abandonment is more than a metric â€” itâ€™s a sign of hesitation, friction, or distraction. By understanding these moments, brands have a golden opportunity to reconnect, re-engage, and recover what was nearly lost. Understanding why users abandon carts isnâ€™t just a technical challenge itâ€™s a strategic imperative. By decoding customer behavior and re-engaging smartly, businesses can transform abandonment into action. With the right mix of technology, behavioral insight, and personalized engagement, what seems like lost revenue can become a powerful recovery engine. In this challenge lies immense opportunity: the potential to turn silence into conversion, and hesitation into loyalty.*
